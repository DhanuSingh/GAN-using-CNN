# GAN-using-CNN
A generative adversarial network developed using CNN. GAN are comprised of two architectures, generator and discriminator. The generator takes in a random input and tries to generate a target. The discriminator is a binary classifier which learns to distinguish between real and generated images. Both of them are trained sequentially.
