# GAN-using-CNN
A generative adversarial network is developed using CNN. GAN are comprised of two architectures, generator and discriminator. The generator takes in a random input and tries to generate a target. The discriminator is a binary classifier which learns to distinguish between real and generated targets. Both of them are trained sequentially. In this particular case MNIST image data is being used to peform the task using CNN architecture of generator and discriminator.
